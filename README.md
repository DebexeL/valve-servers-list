<h5 align="center">My first servers list script released on codecanyon in 2013.</h5>


### A little background..

This is one of my first scripts released on codecanyon when I was starting to learn PHP. I release this for everyone to use for their own purpuses ( learning, using, anyhing ). I recently saw this script and wondered if it still works and I refactored the old deprecated MySql to MySQLi and this is about it. I will support this in order to make it work if someone has problems with it but I will not continue development on this.
